""" Create a function called 'only_lower' that takes a list of strings as an 
argument
and returns another list. This new list will contain only the lowered version of
 the words of the previous list (exclude numbers and punctuation)

Hint:
- google "python isalpha" and play a bit with this method to see how it works

"""

from text import random_text
# Importing a list of strings from the text.py file
# Feel free to open that file and take a look at the list
# Notice how it has been 'tokenized', meaning that every word, number or 
# punctuation is an item of the list

# create a function "only_lower"
# initialize an empty list to store results of list loop
# create loop structure
# condition only add an item from the list if string is alphabetical
# need to convert item to lower case
# add items that first the condition in lower case to empty list
# return new list based on the above

# finally, print results of "only_lower" taking random_text as argument
