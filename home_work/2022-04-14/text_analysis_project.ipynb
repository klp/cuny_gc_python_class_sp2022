    "The requirements are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose one or more texts to work with.\n",
    "- Either save the text files in your working directory, or have python get them from a web address.\n",
    "- If needed: convert your text from bytes to a string\n",
    "- Tokenize your text\n",
    "- Make it an NLTK text object so you can use nltk tools on it\n",
    "- Clean the text in a way that is appropriate for the kind of analysis you want to do.\n",
    "- Run some analysis\n",
    "- Report findings\n",

    "Important notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you plan to use functions have your functions as a separate python file, and import it in your main file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please, over-comment your script. Make sure to comment every step of the way. Make sure to not only explain what you are doing in terms of code, but also your analytical goal too. For instance, both \"I am running a for loop to remove the common words\" and \"I am trying to see how these two authors compare in terms of the ratio of unusual words to total words\" are kind of comments I want to see.\n"
